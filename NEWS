* MooseFS 1.6.0 (2009-07-01)

  - (all) Removed duplicate source files.
  - (all) Strip whitespace at the end of configuration file lines.
  - (cs) Rewritten in multi-threaded model.
  - (cs) Added periodical chunk testing functionality (HDD_TEST_FREQ option).
  - (cs) New -v option (prints version and exits).
  - (master) Added "noowner" objects flag (causes objects to belong to current user).
  - (master) Maintaining `mfsdirinfo` data online, so it doesn't need to be calculated on every request.
  - (master) Filesystem access authorization system (NFS-like mfsexports.cfg file, REJECT_OLD_CLIENTS option) with ro/rw, password and maproot functionality.
  - (master) New -v option (prints version and exits).
  - (mount) Rewritten options parsing in mount-like way, making possible to use standard FUSE mount utilities (see mfsmount(8) manual for new syntax). Note: old syntax is no longer accepted and mountpoint is mandatory now (there is no default).
  - (mount) Updated for FUSE 2.6+.
  - (mount) Added password, file data cache, attribute cache and entry cache options. By default attribute cache and directory entry cache are enabled, file data cache and file entry cache are disabled.
  - (mount) opendir() no longer reads directory contents - it's done on first readdir() now; fixes "rm -r" on recent Linux/glibc/coreutils combo.
  - (mount) Fixed mtime setting just before close() (by flushing file on mtime change); fixes mtime preserving on "cp -p".
  - (mount) Added statistics accessible through MFSROOT/.stats pseudo-file.
  - (mount) Changed master access method for mfstools (direct .master pseudo-file replaced by .masterinfo redirection); fixes possible mfstools race condition and allows to use mfstools on read-only filesystem.
  - (tools) Units cleanup in values display (exact values, IEC-60027/binary prefixes, SI/decimal prefixes); new options: -n, -h, -H and MFSHRFORMAT environment variable - refer to mfstools(8) manual for details).
  - (tools) mfsrgetgoal, mfsrsetgoal, mfsrgettrashtime, mfsrsettrashtime have been deprecated in favour of new "-r" option for mfsgetgoal, mfssetgoal, mfsgettrashtime, mfssettrashtime tools.
  - (tools) mfssnapshot utility replaced by mfsappendchunks (direct descendant of old utility) and mfsmakesnapshot (which creates "real" recursive snapshots and behaves similar to "cp -r").
  - (tools) New mfsfilerepair utility, which allows partial recovery of file with some missing or broken chunks.
  - (cgi) First public version of CGI scripts allowing to monitor MFS installation from WWW browser.
