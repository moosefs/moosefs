  * (master) Added "noowner" objects flag (causes objects to belong to current
    user).
  * (master) Maintaining `mfsdirinfo` data online, so it doesn't need to be
    calculated on every request.
  * (master) Filesystem access authorization system (NFS-like mfsexports.cfg
    file, REJECT_OLD_CLIENTS option) with ro/rw, password and maproot
    functionality.
  * (master) New -v option (prints version and exits).
  * (mount) Rewritten options parsing in mount-like way, making possible to use
    standard FUSE mount utilities (see mfsmount(8) manual for new syntax).
    Note: old syntax is no longer accepted and mountpoint is mandatory now
    (there is no default).
  * (mount) Updated for FUSE 2.6+.

    options. By default attribute cache and directory entry cache are enabled,
    file data cache and file entry cache are disabled.

    readdir() now; fixes "rm -r" on recent Linux/glibc/coreutils combo.

    change); fixes mtime preserving on "cp -p".
  * (mount) Added statistics accessible through MFSROOT/.stats pseudo-file.

    pseudo-file replaced by .masterinfo redirection); fixes possible mfstools
    race condition and allows to use mfstools on read-only filesystem.

    prefixes, SI/decimal prefixes); new options: -n, -h, -H and MFSHRFORMAT
    environment variable - refer to mfstools(8) manual for details).
  * (tools) mfsrgetgoal, mfsrsetgoal, mfsrgettrashtime, mfsrsettrashtime have
    been deprecated in favour of new "-r" option for mfsgetgoal, mfssetgoal,
    mfsgettrashtime, mfssettrashtime tools.
  * (tools) mfssnapshot utility replaced by mfsappendchunks (direct descendant
    of old utility) and mfsmakesnapshot (which creates "real" recursive
    snapshots and behaves similar to "cp -r").
  * (tools) New mfsfilerepair utility, which allows partial recovery of file
    with some missing or broken chunks.
  * (cgi) First public version of CGI scripts allowing to monitor MFS
    installation from WWW browser.
