.SH NAME
mfsarchive \- \fBMooseFS\fP archive storage mode management tools
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mfschkarchive
[\fB-n\fP|\fB-h\fP|\fB-H\fP|\fB-k\fP|\fB-m\fP|\fB-g\fP] \fIOBJECT\fP...
.PP
.B mfsclrarchive
[\fB-n\fP|\fB-h\fP|\fB-H\fP|\fB-k\fP|\fB-m\fP|\fB-g\fP] \fIOBJECT\fP...
.PP
.B mfssetarchive
[\fB-n\fP|\fB-h\fP|\fB-H\fP|\fB-k\fP|\fB-m\fP|\fB-g\fP] \fIOBJECT\fP...
.SH DESCRIPTION
These tools operate on object's archive bit. This bit is usually set automatically according to storage class definition (\fBARCH_DELAY\fP). When this bit is set then \fBARCH_LABELS\fP from storage class definition are used, otherwise \fBKEEP_LABES\fP are used.
.PP
\fBmfschkarchive\fP prints current \fIarchive\fP bit value of given object(s). If given \fIOBJECT\fP is a \fIDIRECTORY\fP then it prints current
\fIarchive\fP bit value of all contained files (recursively).
.PP
\fBmfsclrarchive\fP and \fBmfssetarchive\fP clears/sets current \fIarchive\fP bit of given object(s). As in \fBmfschkarchive\fP if \fIOBJECT\fP is a \fIDIRECTORY\fP then this tool works recursively.
.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
Most of \fBmfstools\fP use \fB-n\fP, \fB-h\fP, \fB-H\fP, \fB-k\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-g\fP
options to select
format of printed numbers. \fB-n\fP causes to print exact numbers, \fB-h\fP
uses binary prefixes (Ki, Mi, Gi as 2^10, 2^20 etc.) while \fB-H\fP uses SI
prefixes (k, M, G as 10^3, 10^6 etc.). \fB-k\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-g\fP show plain numbers
respectivaly in kibis (binary kilo - 1024), mebis (binary mega - 1024^2)
and gibis (binary giga - 1024^3).
The same can be achieved by setting
\fBMFSHRFORMAT\fP environment variable to: \fB0\fP (exact numbers), \fB1\fP
or \fBh\fP (binary prefixes), \fB2\fP or \fBH\fP (SI prefixes), \fB3\fP or
\fBh+\fP (exact numbers and binary prefixes), \fB4\fP or \fBH+\fP (exact
numbers and SI prefixes). The default is to print just exact numbers.
