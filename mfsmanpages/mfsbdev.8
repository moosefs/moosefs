.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool is used to manage block devices. This tool works in Linux ONLY. Kernel
module nbd must be loaded for this tool to work properly.
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
.B start
- starts the daemon; the daemon only listens on a socket at this point;
all the other commands use the socket to communicate with the daemon; if no
socket is specified via -l option, the default is used: /dev/mfs/nbdsock
.PP
.B stop
- stops the daemon
.PP
.B map
- maps a file on mfs to be used as a block device
.PP
.B unmap
- removes a mapping
.PP
.B list
- lists current mappings
.PP
.B resize
- changes the size of a block device (requires kernel version 4.18 or higher)

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.B -H
- master host; default is 'mfsmaster'
.PP
.B -P
- master port; default is '9421'
.PP
.B -p
- master password; mutually exclusive with -x option; if neither -p nor -x are supplied, the tool tries
to connect without a password
.PP
.B -x
- path to a file containing master password; mutually exclusive with -p option; if neither -p nor -x are supplied, the tool tries
to connect without a password
.PP
.B -l
- path to communication socket; default is /dev/mfs/nbdsock
.PP
.B -F
- do not daemonize the tool (run in foreground)
.PP
.B -f
- path to mfs file used to map block device;
.PP
.B -d
- path to network block device ('/dev/nbdX'); by default (if this parameter is not supplied)
first available device is used with the map command
.PP
.B -n
- name of symbolic link created in '/dev/mfs', pointing at the network
block device created by the map command;
default is a combination of master hostname, port and mfs file name
.PP
.B -s
- size of the block device, both SI and IEC suffixes can be used; default is the size
of the file the block device is mapped to
.PP
.B
-t
- forces the list command to display information in a format ready to use with
map (m parameter) or unmap (u parameter) command

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.B mfsbdev start
- start nbd daemon with default options (masterhost = \fBmfsmaster\fP, masterport = \fB9421\fP, linksocket = \fB/dev/mfs/nbdsock\fP, authentication without password)
.PP
.B mfsbdev start -H mfsmaster.my.domain -P 9521 -x /etc/mfs/mastersecret
- start nbd daemon that will connect to master \fBmfsmaster.my.domain\fP on port \fB9521\fP using password read from file \fB/etc/mfs/mastersecret\fP
.PP
.B mfsbdev stop -l /tmp/mynbdinstance
- stop nbd daemon using for communication unix socket \fB/tmp/mynbdinstance\fP
.PP
.B mfsbdev map -f devices/mybdev1.bin -s 2Ti -n mytestvm
- add mapping to daemon using for communication default socket (\fB/dev/mfs/nbdsock\fP). Device will be assigned automatically, file \fBdevices/mybdev1.bin\fP will be mapped to this device, link '/dev/mfs/mytestvm' to this device will be created and block device will have size of 2TiB.
.PP
.B mfsbdev unmap -n mytestvm
- remove mapping that has link named \fBmytestvm\fP (uses link \fB/dev/mfs/mytestvm\fP).
