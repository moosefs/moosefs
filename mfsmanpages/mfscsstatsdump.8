.SH NAME
mfscsstatsdump \- dump usage data from chunkserver stats file in csv or png format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mfscsstatsdump 
\fB-f\fP \fIfields\fP [\fB-i\fP \fIstats_file\fP] [\fB-r\fP \fIrange\fP][\fB-s\fP \fIseparator\fP] [\fB-p\fP \fIpng_filename\fP [\fB-x\fI \fIchart_width\fP] [\fB-y\fP \fIchart_height\fP]] [\fB-hHd\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmfscsstatsdump\fP dumps usage data from chunkserver stats file.
These are the same data sets that are used to make CGI charts. Output can be either in text format (csv)
or in graphical format (png). That means \fB-p\fP, \fB-x\fP and \fB-y\fP options are mutually exclusive with
\fB-h\fP, \fB-H\fP and \fB-d\fP options.
.PP
MooseFS chunkserver saves the stats file in the \fBDATA_PATH\fP directory - see 
.BR mfschunkserver.cfg (5)
