.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmfscheckfile\fP checks and prints number of chunks and number of chunk
copies belonging to specified file(s).
It can be used on any file, included deleted (\fItrash\fP).
.PP
\fBmfsfilerepair\fP deals with broken files (those which cause I/O errors on
read operations) to make them partially readable. In case of missing chunk
it fills missing parts of file with zeros; in case of chunk version mismatch
it sets chunk version known to \fBmfsmaster\fP to highest one found on
chunkservers. Note: because in the second case content mismatch can occur in
chunks with the same version, it is advised to make a copy (not a snapshot!)
and delete original file after "repairing".
.PP
\fBmfsfileinfo\fP prints location (\fIchunkserver\fP host and port) of each
chunk copy belonging to specified file(s).
It can be used on any file, included deleted (\fItrash\fP).
.PP
\fBmfsdirinfo\fP is extended, MooseFS-specific equivalent of \fBdu -s\fP
command. It prints summary for each specified object (single file or
directory tree). If you only want to see one parameter, then add one of
show options (see \fBSHOW OPTIONS\fP). By default it returns data from internal
master counters (very fast, but not precise). All repeated nodes (hard links) and
chunks (snapshots) are counted multiple times. To count stats more preciselly
you can use \fB-p\fP switch which turns on slow, recursive procedure. In this mode
nodes and chunks are counted only once and the system uses current number of chunk
copies instead of goal/labels.
.PP
\fBmfsfilepaths\fP tool can be used to find all occurrences (hard links) of given file 
in filesystem. It can also be used to find a file with given i-node number. 
In case of searching for i-node number, the tool has to be run
in mfs mounted directory.
.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
Most of \fBmfstools\fP use \fB-n\fP, \fB-h\fP, \fB-H\fP, \fB-k\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-g\fP
options to select
format of printed numbers. \fB-n\fP causes to print exact numbers, \fB-h\fP
uses binary prefixes (Ki, Mi, Gi as 2^10, 2^20 etc.) while \fB-H\fP uses SI
prefixes (k, M, G as 10^3, 10^6 etc.). \fB-k\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-g\fP show plain numbers
respectivaly in kibis (binary kilo - 1024), mebis (binary mega - 1024^2)
and gibis (binary giga - 1024^3).
The same can be achieved by setting
\fBMFSHRFORMAT\fP environment variable to: \fB0\fP (exact numbers), \fB1\fP
or \fBh\fP (binary prefixes), \fB2\fP or \fBH\fP (SI prefixes), \fB3\fP or
\fBh+\fP (exact numbers and binary prefixes), \fB4\fP or \fBH+\fP (exact
numbers and SI prefixes). The default is to print just exact numbers.
