.SH DESCRIPTION
These tools operate on object's \fIgoal\fP value,
i.e. the number of copies in which all file data are stored. It means that
file should survive failure of one less chunkservers than its \fIgoal\fP
value. \fIGoal\fP must be set between 1 and 9 (note that 1 is strongly
unadvised).
.PP
\fBmfsgetgoal\fP prints current \fIgoal\fP value of given object(s).
\fB-r\fP option enables recursive mode, which works as usual for every
given file, but for every given directory additionally prints current
\fIgoal\fP value of all contained objects (files and directories).
.PP
\fBmfssetgoal\fP changes current \fIgoal\fP value of given object(s). If new
value is specified in \fIN\fP\fB+\fP form, \fIgoal\fP value is increased to
\fIN\fP for objects with lower \fIgoal\fP value and unchanged for the rest.
Similarly, if new value is specified as \fIN\fP\fB-\fP, \fIgoal\fP value is
decreased to \fIN\fP for objects with higher \fIgoal\fP value and unchanged
for the rest. \fB-r\fP option enables recursive mode.
These tools can be used on any file, directory or deleted (\fItrash\fP) file.
.PP
\fBmfscopygoal\fP tool can be used to copy \fIgoal\fP value from one object to another.
.PP
\fBmfsrgetgoal\fP and \fBmfsrsetgoal\fP are deprecated aliases for
\fBmfsgetgoal -r\fP and \fBmfssetgoal -r\fP respectively.
.SH STORAGE CLASSES
Since version 3.0 of MooseFS goal has been extended to storage classes.
Using storage classes user can also specify chunkservers on which copies should be stored
by defining label expressions. To maintain compatibility with standard goal semantics, there are
predefined storage classes from 1 to 9. Goal tools simply work only on these classes.
To achieve more sophisticated storage scenarios use sclass tools (\fBmfsgetsclass\fP,\fBmfssetsclass\fP,...)
.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
Most of \fBmfstools\fP use \fB-n\fP, \fB-h\fP, \fB-H\fP, \fB-k\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-g\fP
options to select
format of printed numbers. \fB-n\fP causes to print exact numbers, \fB-h\fP
uses binary prefixes (Ki, Mi, Gi as 2^10, 2^20 etc.) while \fB-H\fP uses SI
prefixes (k, M, G as 10^3, 10^6 etc.). \fB-k\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-g\fP show plain numbers
respectivaly in kibis (binary kilo - 1024), mebis (binary mega - 1024^2)
and gibis (binary giga - 1024^3).
The same can be achieved by setting
\fBMFSHRFORMAT\fP environment variable to: \fB0\fP (exact numbers), \fB1\fP
or \fBh\fP (binary prefixes), \fB2\fP or \fBH\fP (SI prefixes), \fB3\fP or
\fBh+\fP (exact numbers and binary prefixes), \fB4\fP or \fBH+\fP (exact
numbers and SI prefixes). The default is to print just exact numbers.
.SH INHERITANCE
When new object is created in MooseFS, attributes such as storage class, trashtime and extra
attributes are inherited from parent directory. So if you set i.e. "noowner"
attribute and storage class to "important" in a directory then every new object created in
this directory will have storage class set to "important" and "noowner" flag set. A newly created
object inherits always the current set of its parent's attributes. Changing a
directory attribute does not affect its already created children. To change
an attribute for a directory and all of its children use \fB-r\fP option.
