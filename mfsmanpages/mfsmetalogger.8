.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBmfsmetalogger\fP is the metadata replication server of Moose File System.
Depending on parameters it can start, restart or stop MooseFS metalogger process.
Without any options it starts MooseFS metalogger, killing previously run process
if lock file exists.
.PP
SIGHUP (or 'reload' \fIACTION\fP) forces \fBmfsmetalogger\fP to reload all configuration files.
.PP
mfsmetalogger exists since 1.6.5 version of MooseFS; before this version
\fBmfschunkserver\fP\|(8) was responsible of logging metadata changes.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP

.TP
\fB\-h\fP

.TP
\fB\-f\fP
(deprecated, use \fBstart\fP action instead)
forcily run MooseFS metalogger process, without trying to kill previous instance
(this option allows to run MooseFS metalogger if stale PID file exists)
.TP
\fB\-s\fP
(deprecated, use \fBstop\fP action instead)
stop MooseFS metalogger process
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fICFGFILE\fP
specify alternative path of configuration file (default is
\fBmfsmetalogger.cfg\fP in system configuration directory)
.TP
\fB\-u\fP
log undefined configuration values (when default is assumed)
.TP
\fB\-d\fP
run in foreground, don't daemonize
.TP
\fB\-t\fP \fILOCKTIMEOUT\fP
how long to wait for lockfile (default is 60 seconds)
.TP
\fIACTION\fP
is the one of \fBstart\fP, \fBstop\fP, \fBrestart\fP, \fBreload\fP, \fBtest\fP or \fBkill\fP. Default action is
\fBrestart\fP unless \fB\-s\fP (stop) or \fB\-f\fP (start) option is given.
Note that \fB\-s\fP and \fB\-f\fP options are deprecated, likely to disappear
and \fIACTION\fP parameter to become obligatory in MooseFS 1.7.
