.SH DESCRIPTION
These tools are used to check, define and delete quotas. Quota is set on a directory. It can be set in one
of 4 ways: for number of inodes inside the directory (total sum of the
subtree's inodes) with \fB-i\fP, \fB-I\fP options, for sum of (logical) file lengths with
\fB-l\fP, \fB-L\fP options,
for sum of chunk sizes (not considering goals) with \fB-s\fP, \fB-S\fP options and for physical
hdd space (more or less chunk sizes multiplied by goal of each chunk) with \fB-r\fP, \fB-R\fP options.
Small letters set soft quota, capital letters set hard quota. \fB-a\fP and \fB-A\fP options in
\fBmfsdelquota\fP mean all kinds of quota. Quota behaviour is described below.
For soft quota grace period can be defined using \fB-p\fP option. When grace period is not given then
default value will be used (option defined in mfsmaster.cfg or seven days if it's not defined there).
.PP
Quota is always set on a directory. Hard quota cannot be exceeded anytime.
Soft quota can be exceeded for a specified period of time. Once a quota is exceeded in a
directory, user must go below the quota during the grace period. If not, the soft 
quota for this particular directory starts to behave like a hard quota.
.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
Most of \fBmfstools\fP use \fB-n\fP, \fB-h\fP, \fB-H\fP, \fB-k\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-g\fP
options to select
format of printed numbers. \fB-n\fP causes to print exact numbers, \fB-h\fP
uses binary prefixes (Ki, Mi, Gi as 2^10, 2^20 etc.) while \fB-H\fP uses SI
prefixes (k, M, G as 10^3, 10^6 etc.). \fB-k\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-g\fP show plain numbers
respectivaly in kibis (binary kilo - 1024), mebis (binary mega - 1024^2)
and gibis (binary giga - 1024^3).
The same can be achieved by setting
\fBMFSHRFORMAT\fP environment variable to: \fB0\fP (exact numbers), \fB1\fP
or \fBh\fP (binary prefixes), \fB2\fP or \fBH\fP (SI prefixes), \fB3\fP or
\fBh+\fP (exact numbers and binary prefixes), \fB4\fP or \fBH+\fP (exact
numbers and SI prefixes). The default is to print just exact numbers.
