.SH DESCRIPTION
These tools operate on object's \fIstorage class\fP name. This is an extended version of classic goal.
There are predefined storage classes provided as equivalents of goals 1 to 9 (names are simply "1","2",...,"9"). Other classes 
can be created/modified/deleted etc. by administrator using \fBmfsscadmin\fP tool.
.PP
\fBmfsgetsclass\fP prints current \fIstorage class\fP of given object(s).
\fB-r\fP option enables recursive mode, which works as usual for every
given file, but for every given directory additionally prints current
\fIstorage class\fP of all contained objects (files and directories).
.PP
\fBmfssetsclass\fP changes current \fIstorage class\fP of given object(s).
\fB-r\fP option enables recursive mode.
.PP
\fBmfscopysclass\fP copies \fIstorage class\fP from one object to given object(s).
.PP
\fBmfsxchgsclass\fP sets \fIstorage class\fP to \fIDST_SCLASS_NAME\fP of given objects(s) but only
when current \fIstorage class\fP is set to \fISRC_SCLASS_NAME\fP.
.PP
\fBmfslistsclass\fP lists currently defined storage classes.
\fB-l\fP option enables long format - whole class definition is printed for each class, not only its name. For 
description of storage class definition refer to \fBmfsscadmin\fP manpage.
.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
Most of \fBmfstools\fP use \fB-n\fP, \fB-h\fP, \fB-H\fP, \fB-k\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-g\fP
options to select
format of printed numbers. \fB-n\fP causes to print exact numbers, \fB-h\fP
uses binary prefixes (Ki, Mi, Gi as 2^10, 2^20 etc.) while \fB-H\fP uses SI
prefixes (k, M, G as 10^3, 10^6 etc.). \fB-k\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-g\fP show plain numbers
respectivaly in kibis (binary kilo - 1024), mebis (binary mega - 1024^2)
and gibis (binary giga - 1024^3).
The same can be achieved by setting
\fBMFSHRFORMAT\fP environment variable to: \fB0\fP (exact numbers), \fB1\fP
or \fBh\fP (binary prefixes), \fB2\fP or \fBH\fP (SI prefixes), \fB3\fP or
\fBh+\fP (exact numbers and binary prefixes), \fB4\fP or \fBH+\fP (exact
numbers and SI prefixes). The default is to print just exact numbers.
.SH INHERITANCE
When new object is created in MooseFS, attributes such as storage class, trashtime and extra
attributes are inherited from parent directory. So if you set i.e. "noowner"
attribute and storage class to "important" in a directory then every new object created in
this directory will have storage class set to "important" and "noowner" flag set. A newly created
object inherits always the current set of its parent's attributes. Changing a
directory attribute does not affect its already created children. To change
an attribute for a directory and all of its children use \fB-r\fP option.
