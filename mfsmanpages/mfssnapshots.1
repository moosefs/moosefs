.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmfsappendchunks\fP (equivalent of \fBmfssnapshot\fP from MooseFS 1.5)
appends a lazy copy of specified file(s) to specified snapshot file ("lazy"
means that creation of new chunks is delayed to the moment one copy is
modified).
If multiple files are given, they are merged into one target file in such a way
that each file begins at \fIchunk\fP (64MB) boundary; padding space is left
empty.
.PP
\fBmfsmakesnapshot\fP makes a "real" snapshot (lazy copy, like in case of
\fBmfsappendchunks\fP) of some object(s) or subtree (similarly to \fBcp -r\fP
command). It's atomic with respect to each \fISOURCE\fP argument separately.
If \fIDESTINATION\fP points to already existing file, error will be reported
unless \fB-o\fP (overwrite) option is given. Note: if \fISOURCE\fP is
a directory, it is copied as a whole; but if it's followed by trailing slash,
only directory content is copied.
.PP
\fBmfsrmsnapshot\fP removes objects created as a result of
\fBmfsmakesnapshot\fP (similarly to \fBrm -r\fP, but much faster). For safety
reasons objects created via \fBmfsmakesnapshot\fP have the \fBsnapshot\fP
attribute set (see \fBmfseattr\fP(1)) and only such objects can be removed
using \fBmfsrmsnapshot\fP command. By default all files and directories inside
specified directory must have this attribute set for the command to remove the
whole directory; otherwise the command will not remove anything. This behavior
can be overridden by \fB-f\fP option. With this option \fBmfsrmsnapshot\fP will
remove only those files/directories that have \fBsnapshot\fP attribute set and
will leave everything else untouched.
