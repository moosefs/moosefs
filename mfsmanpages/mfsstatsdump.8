.SH NAME
mfsstatsdump \- dump usage data from master stats file in csv or png format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mfsstatsdump
\fB-f\fP \fIfields\fP [\fB-i\fP \fIstats_file\fP] [\fB-r\fP \fIrange\fP] [\fB-s\fP \fIseparator\fP] [\fB-p\fP \fIpng_filename\fP [\fB-x\fP \fIchart_width\fP] [\fB-y\fP \fIchart_height\fP]] [\fB-hHd\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmfsstatsdump\fP dumps usage data from master stats file.
These are the same data sets that are used to make GUI charts. Output can be either in text format (csv)
or in graphical format (png). That means \fB-p\fP, \fB-x\fP and \fB-y\fP options are mutually exclusive with
\fB-h\fP, \fB-H\fP and \fB-d\fP options.
.PP
MooseFS master server saves the stats file in the \fBDATA_PATH\fP directory - see 
.BR mfsmaster.cfg (5)
.SS OUTPUT
Text output - text (csv) file where first column is a timestamp (or date if \fB-d\fP option
was specified), the following column are what was specified with the \fB-f\fP options, formatted
according to used options (none, \fB-s\fP and \fB-h\fP or \fB-H\fP)
.PP
Graphical output - one png file with a chart is created for every
field specified with the \fB-f\fP option, according to the naming scheme declared
with the \fB-p\fP option. Size may be adjusted with \fB-x\fP and \fB-y\fP options.

.SH NOTES
.PP
Data sets \fBdelete\fP and \fBdelete_stat\fP in a properly working system should be roughly the same, but not always identical (in their CSV form), this stems from the fact that
the \fBdelete\fP set is calculated using the number of requests sent by the master, and the \fBdelete_stat\fP set is calculated using the number of replies received from chunk servers, 
so local fluctuations may be observed (i.e. one minute has more sent requests - higher value in the \fBdelete\fP set and the next minute has more answers - higher value in \fBdelete_stat\fP set).
But if one were to calculate the sum of differences between the two sets over time, this sum should never grow over a certain number.
.PP
However, if there is some kind of problem (with network communication and/or chunk server process(es)) and some chunk delete requests are stalled/go missing, then \fBdelete\fP values may be 
constantly higher than the \fBdelete_stat\fP values and the sum of differences between the two sets will be steadily growing over time.
.PP
Same goes for \fBreplicate\fP(_stat), \fBcreate\fP(_stat), \fBchange\fP(_stat) and \fBsplit\fP(_stat) data sets.
